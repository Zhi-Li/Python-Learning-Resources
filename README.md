WELCOME
===================

This is a set of useful resources for python learning. 

I highly recommend the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)(interactive data science and scientific computing tool).

For anyone who want to share and view jupyter notebook, [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) can be an efficient tool.
